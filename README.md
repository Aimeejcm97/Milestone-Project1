Myers Patissiere Hire Page
For my project, I chose to create a simple website for a growing affordable luxury baking company. The aim of the project was to provide potential customers with an easily accessible
Description of the company as well as giving insight into previous works and qualifications.

I wanted the website to allow potential customers to view a portfolio of creations made by the company and allow them to contact them to inquire about the services and prices offered.
UX
 
I built this website with the potential customers of the business in mind. When choosing the color palette for my website I took into account how long people stare at screens as well as research that shows certain colors and color combinations can cause eye strain headaches and blurred vision. I chose muted darker colors and cream shades to reduce the potential of strain that brighter colors and flat white text can cause.
The implementation of a contact form allows users interested in hiring the company an easy way of notifying the business about their interest and asking any questions they may have.
A portfolio of previous works by the employees of the company will show the users the quality of the products that they may be looking to purchase and to make sure that the products and services sold by the company are what they are looking for.
The links in the footer allow the user to quickly access the businesses’ social media where they can see other customers’ reviews as well as being able to see what the company is currently working on.
Features
Existing Features

Testing
When I was writing all the code I used repl.it so that I could check all of my work as I was working on it.https://repl.it/@AimeeM97/Milestone-1
I tested the website on all screen sizes from desktop to phones to ensure that it worked the same on them all.
I also tested the contact page to ensure that a message popped up if a required field was not filled out.
Deployment
 
I run my code locally through repl.it and keep a saved backup of in using notepad on my computer.
